Description: This package was designed for preference test
    evaluation and simulation. The focus lies on new item positioning at a
    given number of initial preference tests. Various position tests and
    simulations are possible that randomize open item combinations and
    allow the estimation of a new item's position. However, if your
    preference test shows a side-dependency, we cannot help you. Such data
    can be simulated but the outcome will be biased.
