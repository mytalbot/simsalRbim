Preference tests are a valuable tool to measure the "wants" of individuals and 
have been proven to be a valid method to rate different commodities. The number
of commodities presented at the same time is, however, limited and in classical
test settings usually, only two options are presented. In our paper, we 
evaluate the option of combining multiple binary choices to rank preferences 
among a larger number of commodities. The **simsalRbim** package offers the 
necessary tools to test selections of commodities and to obtain an estimate of 
new or incompletely tested items and their relative position.

## Data availability
Besides the internal ZickeZacke data, we provide additional experimental data
from six different preference tests. These data can be downloaded from a 
separate [GitHub](https://github.com/mytalbot/simsalRbim_data) repository and 
can be used directly in this package (e.g., with the bimload function).

## Dependencies

**simsalRbim** was developed on R (v4.0.3). It depends on the following
packages (in no particular order, excluding R base packages) and may have to 
be installed manually. 

dplyr  
ggplot2  
gnm  
prefmod  
reshape2  
rlang  
stringr  
viridis  
ggrepel  

The following function can be used to install single packages - or just
the missing ones from CRAN.  

```{r
install.packages("paste missing package name here")

```

### Installation

The development version of the simsalRbim package can be downloaded from GitHub
with the following command.

```{r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mytalbot/simsalRbim@main")
library(simsalRbim)
```

#### Manual installation
The source/binary files are also available [here:](
https://github.com/mytalbot/simsalRbim_binaries)

 
## Example

This example uses the internal data (ZickeZacke) to perform a simple
randomization on the positioning of the incomplete 'HoiHoiHoi' item. 

*Note:* The GT data must contain all possible pairwise item comparisons. 

```{r example, out.width="70%"}
library(simsalRbim)

dat        <- ZickeZacke

simOpt     <- "HoiHoiHoi"
GT         <- c("Zacke", "Huehner", "Kacke",  "Zicke" )

predat     <- bimpre(dat=dat, GT=GT, simOpt=simOpt)

worth      <- bimworth(ydata    = predat,
                       GT       = GT,
                       simOpt   = simOpt,
                       randOP   = FALSE, # TRUE enables a randomized run
                       showPlot = "worth")
```
